Changes I made:

1. Dark & Light Theme Toggle
- Why i did it:
To give users control over their visual experience, reduce eye strain in low-light environments, and improve accessibility.

- Impact:
Increases visual comfort and personalization
Improves accessibility for users with visual sensitivity

2. Animations
- Why i did it:
To bring interactivity through animations like slide-up and hover effects.

- Impact:
Adds visual polish and smoothness
Helps guide user attention naturally
Makes the app feel alive and well-crafted

3. Image
- Why i did it:
 I integrated a consistent image (e.g. Waste.jpg) across all cards to improve the visual appeal and contextual relevance of each option. 

- Impact:
Users process images faster than text â€” including imagery makes the cards more attractive.
A photo of a waste scene subtly communicates what the product is and what it's used for.
